### Privacy
Defensive security is a multi-faceted concern to individuals, requiring solutions that can address multiple challenges. BlockchainMe is a tool to promote the encryption layer of cryptocurrency, to help prevent skimming, catfishing, counterfeiting and other fraudulent activity are critical. 

### Verifiable
BlockchainMe utilizes proof-of-existence, your information is never sent or stored centrally on any database. You own your information. Your Id is only verifiable by the people you chose to give it to. This is a voluntary identification service that adapts to the increasingly diversified needs for contextual identity.  

### Identity  
BlockchainMe offers counterfeit-resistant and tamper-proof identification credentials that hold the only the information you choose. Use your name or pseudonym, and to build on your network by signing keys.

### Decentralized
The decentralized structure of the blockchain ensures that no one entity has control of the data or the power to enforce arbitrary limits on it.  Decentralization gives back the users the control of their data.

### Web of Trust
Strengthening your social network. Exchange IOU’s/loans with any member based on degrees of trust, and encourage collaboration.
